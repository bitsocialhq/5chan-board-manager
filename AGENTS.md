- communities or subplebbit are the equivalent plebbit-js term for "board" in 5chan
- Subplebbits are equivalent to community, which are essentially the same as boards in 5chan
- Every new feature or bug fix must include a test case that reproduces/covers it
- Never use `any` — always use proper types
- After modifying any file under `src/`, run `npx tsc --noEmit` to verify the build has no type errors
- After modifying types in `src/types.ts`, run `npx tsc --noEmit` to ensure all dependents still compile
- All code must work on Linux, macOS, and Windows — avoid platform-specific assumptions (paths, line endings, shell commands, etc.)
- Assume environment is node v22+
- When changing functionality (new features, refactors, CLI changes, etc.), update README.md if the change affects documented behavior, commands, APIs, or examples
